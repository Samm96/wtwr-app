## 🤖 About the project 🤖

**Full-stack application.** Use the following frameworks:

- React.js
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose

* The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

* Utilized tools such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as the M.E.R.N stack and Node.js.

* Connected to a weather API and handled received data to generate the proper date, weather and location.

* Deployed the app on Google Cloud using: NGINX; Certbot to attain certificates and enable HTTPS; and PM2 to keep the server running.
